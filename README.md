# ATBS-Search
--- 

1. search.py
    - takes command line arguments and then searchs pypi.org and gets the first 5 projects/links that come up from the search and opens them
    - to setup: on the command line (in the directory of the file) type
    
    > chmod +x search.py
     
    to give permission to the file and then type
    
    >./search.py keyword 
    
    (keyword is the thing to search for).

2. dokkanSearch.py
    - This program is similar has search.py except it gets the top two links to the dokkan wiki
    - to setup: on the command line (in the directory of the file) type
    
    > chmod +x dokkanSearch.py 
    
    to give permission to the file and then type 
    
    >./dokkanSearch.py keyword 
    
    (keyword is the thing to search for).

3. Reasoning?
    - This is awesome having a program search and then open the web page for you without having to click much
    - The dokkan search is building off of the search.py and searching my current favorite game's wiki for things I'm looking for. Which in saying that outloud is super sureal.
